OVERVIEW
--------
SimD (Simple DDS) is an abstraction layer that provides a very compact way of
programming implementation of the OMG DDS standard. The implementation
of SimD has currently been tested only with OpenSplice DDS, however
its code is practically implementation dependent

For contribution, feedback or comments please contact 
Angelo Corsaro<angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The requirements for compiling and running SimD are:

    - OpenSplice DDS v4.1 or higher (http:://www.opensplice.org)
    - BOOST v1.40 (or higher)
    - GCC/G++ v4.1 (or higher)


BOOST
-----
SimD requires the BOOST_INCLUDE and BOOST_LIB environment variables to
point to the boost installation containing headers and libraries
respectively.


COMPILING
---------
Once you've obtained a copy of SimD  you need to do the following:

$ ./configure
$ source simd.env
$ cd build
$ make install

Once you'll have done that check out one of the examples available
under $SIMD_HOME/demo
