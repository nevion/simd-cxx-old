OVERVIEW
--------
SimD (Simple DDS) is an abstraction layer that provides a very compact way of
programming implementation of the OMG DDS standard. The implementation
of SimD has currently been tested only with OpenSplice DDS, however
its code is practically implementation dependent

Angelo Corsaro<angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The requirements for compiling and running SimD are:

    - OpenSplice DDS v4.1 or higher (http:://www.opensplice.org)
    - BOOST v1.40 (or higher)
    - BOOST Process (Already shipped with SimD)
    - GCC/G++ v4.1 (or higher)
    - CMake v2.6 (or higher)
    - Doxygen
 

BOOST
-----
SimD requires the BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR and BOOST_LIB_DIR environment variables to
point to the boost installation containing headers and libraries
respectively.


COMPILING
---------
Once you've obtained a copy of SimD, decide where you want to install it,
and let the SIMD_INSTALL_DIR environment variable point to this location.
Then, do the following:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SIMD_INSTALL_DIR ..
$ make install



Once you'll have done that check out one of the examples available
under $SIMD_HOME/demo

The demo are compiled as follows:

$ cmake .
$ make
