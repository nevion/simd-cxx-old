OVERVIEW
--------
SimD (Simple DDS) is an abstraction layer that provides a very compact way of
programming implementation of the OMG DDS standard. The implementation
of SimD has currently been tested only with OpenSplice DDS, however
its code is practically implementation dependent

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The requirements for compiling and running SimD are:

    - OpenSplice DDS v5.x  (http:://www.opensplice.org)
    - BOOST v1.40 (or higher)
    - BOOST Process (Already shipped with SimD)
    - GCC/G++ v4.1 (or higher)
    - CMake v2.6 (or higher)
    - Doxygen
 

BOOST
-----
If BOOST is not installed on the standard include path, than
SimD requires the BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR and BOOST_LIB_DIR environment variables to
point to the boost installation containing headers and libraries
respectively.


CONFIGURING the OpenSplice DDS Version
-----------

OpenSplice DDS v6.x has introduced a chance in the
DomainParticipantFactory API which now expects the domainId to be an
integer (before was a string). 

SimD will supports OpenSplice DDS v5.x as well as v6.x but in order for
it to compile properly you need to set the right version on the file:

   ./src/dds/ospl-ver.hpp

For instance, for OpenSplice DDS v6.1 the setting should be:

#define SIMD_OSPL_MAJ_VER 6
#define SIMD_OSPL_MIN_VER 1

While for OpenSplice DDS v5.5 would be:

#define SIMD_OSPL_MAJ_VER 5
#define SIMD_OSPL_MIN_VER 5



COMPILING
---------
Once you've obtained a copy of SimD, decide where you want to install it,
and let the SIMD_INSTALL_DIR environment variable point to this location.
Then, do the following:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SIMD_INSTALL_DIR ..
$ make install



Once you'll have done that check out one of the examples available
under $SIMD_HOME/demo

The demo are compiled as follows:

$ cmake .
$ make
