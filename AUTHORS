SIMD has been designed and implemented by Angelo Corsaro
<angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>.  The key goal of SIMD, other than making
simpler the use of a powerful technology such as the OMG DDS, is to
explore new DDS C++ APIs for standardization.

Please consider providing feedback and contribution to the SIMD
project, and for any kind of question feel free to contact me at
