What is it?
----------
ishapes is a demo that has been used to test interoperability among DDS vendors while being able to show something "moving on the screen".

The demo is about shapes that bounce within a rectangular region.


Building the Demo
-----------------

To build the demo you need to have installed a QT4 development
environment. Assuming that this is the case, then you'll need to simply do the following:

$ make


GUI, IDL, and  Makefile Regeneration
------------------------------------
If you need to regenerate all the project, then do the  following:


$ make Makefile.idl
$ qmake ishapes.pro
$ make


Running ishapes
---------------

The ishapes demo allows you to publish and subscribe instances of
various shapes. The demo is nicer if you run it as at least two
instances, thus do:

$ ./ishapes &
$ ./ishapes &

At this point let one of the application publish some shapes and the
other application some other.
