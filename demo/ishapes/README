What is it?
----------
iShapes is a demo that has been used to test interoperability among
DDS vendors while being able to show something "moving on the screen".

The demo is about shapes that bounce within a rectangular region.


Configuring the Demo
--------------------

The iShapes demo is often used to learn the basics of DDS as well as
test the interoperability between DDS implementations. In addition,
the iShapes demo is used by several BlendBox (B2) demo to demonstrate
some of the mediating, routing and processing capabilities provided by
B2.

As the topic definition used by B2 and the interoperability demo are
slightly different you can control which version you want to build by
properly defining the ISHAPES_B2_DEMO.

If you want to build the iShapes demo for the B2 you need to ensure
that the config.h file contains the following definition:

#define ISHAPES_B2_DEMO 1

Otherwise if you want the iShapes application to be built for interoperability, you need to define it as follows:

#define ISHAPES_B2_DEMO 0




Building the Demo
-----------------
To build the demo you need to have installed a QT4 development
environment. Assuming that this is the case, then you'll need to
simply do the following:

$ cmake .
$ make




Running ishapes
---------------

The ishapes demo allows you to publish and subscribe instances of
various shapes. The demo is nicer if you run it as at least two
instances, thus do:

$ ./ishapes &
$ ./ishapes &

At this point let one of the application publish some shapes and the
other application some other.
