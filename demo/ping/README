PING DEMO
---------

This is a simple ping application that other than demonstrating the
use of SIMD has also been used to demonstrate interoberabilty between
OpenSplice DDS and other OMG DDS implementations.

COMPILE
-------

The distributed version already includes generated IDL files. However if you change version of OpenSplice DDS or you port SIMD to another DDS implementation you'll need to re-generate IDLs. To do so, simply execute:

$ make idl

To make the application simply type:

$ make
