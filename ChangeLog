	* src/simd/*.hpp: removed forward declaration of classes within
	the simd namespace to work around some parsing issues that were
	preventing proper code-aid in NetBeans.

	* configure: Now also adds required BOOST libraries from what
	installed on the target machien (previously BOOST 1.39.0 was
	assumed)
	
	* README: Removed reference to the SWATCH project.
	
	* src/simd/writer.hpp: addedd missing "return" on write methods.
        * src/simd/reader.hpp: removed scope qualifier to address compilation
          issues with gcc 4.2.

	Thanks to Reynald Bourtembourg for catchings this.
