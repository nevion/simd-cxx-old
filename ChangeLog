2010-03-25  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Changed order for doc documentation
	
	* README, INSTALL: Updated to reflect CMake build system

2010-03-02  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>
	* src/dds/qos.hpp: Fixed typo in the set_reliable(DDS::Duration_t timeout).

2010-02-12  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* Changed build system to CMake. This will allow to build SimD on
	Linux, Windows and MacOS.

	* Added support for content filtered topics

	* src/dds/*.hpp: Added export macro required by microsoft compilers.

	* src/dds/runtime.hpp/cpp: Removed start/stop method from the
	Runtime class as this were not exception safe. Now your code
	has simply to create a Runtime object whose constructor will call
	"start" and distructor will call the "stop".


2009-12-23  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/dds/instance_writer.hpp: Fixed dispose method to properly
	pass key + instance handle.

	* src/dds/assertion.hpp (dds): Fixed mispelling "poscondition" ->
	"postcondition"

	* src/dds/writer.hpp (DataWriter): Fixed mispelling in the
	forwarding of the write with timestamp method.

	* src/dds/peer/writer_impl.hpp (DataWriterImpl): Fixed method that
	writes data with time-stamp to call the legacy API
	write_w_timestamp.

2009-12-05  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* Updated:
	     - namespace from "simd" to "dds"

	     - updated internal implementation of the API to being to use
	consistently the pimpl idiom while keeping the implementation in
	a separate directory

	      - updated ishapes demo


2009-10-06  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* demo/ishapes:

	  Added OpenSplice DDS ishapes demo which allows you to visually
	  play with pub/sub. Notice that the demo does not allow yet to
	  configure QoS (although a QoS button exist on the GUI).

	* configure: 

	  Removed generation of -l for BOOST libraries.

	  Fixed erroneous hard-coded path included in the file

	* config/lib/BOOST.MACROS.GNU: 

	  This file includes defaults BOOST libraries include. Customize
	  it if needed (esp. if using BOOST < 1.40).


2009-09-15  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/simd/traits.hpp: Moved handle_body_traits here from condition.hpp

	* src/simd/topic.hpp: Now owns reference to DomainParticipant

	* src/simd/runtime.hpp: * src/simd/runtime.cpp: Added finalization
	method and changed <init> to <start>.

	* src/simd/qos.hpp: 
	* src/simd/qos.cpp: 

	  Reformatting.

	* demo/ping/ping-sub.cpp: 
	* demo/ping/ping-pub.cpp: 
	* demo/ping/ping-asub.cpp: 

	* demo/hello/hello-sub.cpp: 
	* demo/hello/hello-pub.cpp: 

	  Updated demos to reflect changes into the Runtime API.

	* src/simd/reader.hpp: 
	* src/simd/config.hpp: 
	* src/simd/condition.hpp: 
	* src/simd/condition.cpp: 

	  Updated condition to simplify their creation and allow for safe
	  downcasting when needed (e.g. when getting conditions out of a
	  WaitSet).

	* src/simd/instance_writer.hpp: Removed some warning due to some
	missing return vals.
	
	* demo/ping/ping-sub.cpp: Updated to show the use of the extended
	Condition API.

2009-09-08  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/simd/runtime.hpp: 
	* src/simd/memory.hpp: 
	  Removed OpenSplice DDS includes	
	
	* src/simd/instance_writer.hpp: 
	* src/simd/writer.hpp: 
	  Removed explicit dependency from boost::shared_ptr.

	* src/simd/config.hpp: Added OpenSplice DDS specific includes.

2009-08-31  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* demo/ping/ping-sub.cpp: 
	* demo/ping/ping-pub.cpp: 
	* demo/ping/ping-asub.cpp: 

	* demo/hello/hello-sub.cpp: 
	* demo/hello/hello-pub.cpp: 

	  Updated demo examples to reflect API changes described below.



	* src/simd/writer.hpp: 

	* src/simd/waitset.hpp: 
	* src/simd/waitset.cpp: 

	* src/simd/topic.hpp: 

	* src/simd/runtime.hpp: 

	* src/simd/reader.hpp: 

	* src/simd/memory.cpp: 

	* src/simd/condition.hpp: 
	* src/simd/condition.cpp: 

	  Made Topic(s)/DataReader(s)/DataWriter(s) as reference
	  objects. Now in the API the boost::shared_ptr is no more
	  visible, this is used internally yet the user gets reference
	  sematics for all the DDS entities. Othern than making the API
	  simpler, this also makes it safer.

	  
2009-08-25  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/simd/condition.hpp:
	* src/simd/waitset.hpp: Fixed implementation for ExecutableConditions.

2009-08-21  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/simd/simd.hpp:
	* src/simd/simd.cpp: Main header file that application need to include.

	* src/simd/waitset.hpp:
	* src/simd/waitset.cpp: Implemented SimD executable waitset.

	* src/simd/reader.hpp: Added registration logic for listener events.

2009-08-17  Angelo Corsaro  <angelocorsaro@gmail.com>

	* demo/ping/ping-*.cpp: updated to reflect changes in the SimD API.

2009-08-16  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/simd/condition.cpp:
	* src/simd/condition.hpp:
	* src/simd/reader.hpp

	  Added support for waitset and conditions. SimD also provides a
	  new kind of Condition which can dispatch call to a specified
	  functor. 

2009-08-12  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* src/simd/*.hpp: removed forward declaration of classes within
	the simd namespace to work around some parsing issues that were
	preventing proper code-aid in NetBeans.

	* configure: Now also adds required BOOST libraries from what
	installed on the target machien (previously BOOST 1.39.0 was
	assumed)
	
	* README: Removed reference to the SWATCH project.
	
	* src/simd/writer.hpp: addedd missing "return" on write methods.
        * src/simd/reader.hpp: removed scope qualifier to address compilation
          issues with gcc 4.2.

	Thanks to Reynald Bourtembourg for catchings this.

2009-07-20  Angelo Corsaro  <angelo.corsaro@gmail.com>

	* Release SimD v0.1-alpha
