To install the SIMD source distribution you'll need to ensure that BOOST is properly installed in your machine and that two environment variable are pointing to the include and libraries directory for BOOST. Namely:

BOOST_INCLUDE: points at the include directory
BOOST_LIB: points at the library directory

Once BOOST is properly installed and configured, simply do the following:

$./configure
$ . simd.env
$ make


Then to see if you installation was successful try out a demo:

cd ./demo/ping

$ make

$ ./ping-pub --period 100

$ ./ping-asub --samples 10
